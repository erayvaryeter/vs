        Remote debugging allows you to debug programs which run on a different computer than the computer where Visual Studio is running.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this release of Visual Studio, remote debugging has never been easier. Basic steps:
    </p>
    <ol role='directory' aria-labelledby='RemoteDebuggingOverviewLabel'>
        <li>Run the remote debugger (msvsmon.exe) on the computer that you want to debug to.
            See the <a href="#RemoteDebuggingSetupHelp"> setup help</a> for more information. </li>
        <li><span id='ConfigureVSRemoteDebuggerLabel'>Configure Visual Studio to connect to the remote debugger</span>
            <ul role='directory' aria-labelledby='ConfigureVSRemoteDebuggerLabel'>
                <li><em>If you want to launch a C#/VB project:</em> Open properties for your project (right click
                    in solution explorer), and on the Debug tab, check the option to use a remote machine.</li>
                <li><em>If you want to launch a C++ project:</em> Open properties for your project (right click
                    in solution explorer), and on the Debugger menu, change the Debugger to Launch value
                    to Remote Windows Debugger. Set the Remote Command property to path that the remote
                    computer should use.</li>
                <li><em>To attach to an already running process:</em> Start the Attach to Process dialog from
                    the Tools or Debug menu, and enter the remote computer name into the Qualifier edit
                    box.</li>
                <li><em>To debug a web site:</em> Open the web site from a remote file share, and then configure
                    the Custom Web Server property to the web server's URL (exe: http://myserver).</li>
                <li><em>To launch an executable without a project:</em> Create a debugger project by opening
                    the executable as a project (File->Open Project) and entering the path to the executable
                    that you want to debug (ex: \\MyTestComputer\c$\MyTest.exe). Then open project properties
                    and change the Connection property. Also adjust the Executable property to the path
                    that the remote computer should use.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Start debugging </li>

                they would be able to take over the user account of the user running the remote
                debugger. User names should be semicolon or comma separated (example: SomeDomain\Bob;SomeDomain\Alice)

            </td>
            <td class='TableCell'>
                On Windows x64, the remote debugger listens on an additional port to allow debugging 32-bit processes
                running under the WOW64 (Windows 32-bit On Windows 64-bit) emulation layer. The /wow64port option
                allows this port number to be configured. This may be useful to accommodate a hardware firewall. 
                If unspecified, the debugger will attempt to use 4025, but will fall back to any unused port if 4025 
                is already in use.
                <br /><br />

                Note that it is not recommended to ask Visual Studio to directly connect to this port, as this will only 
                allow for debugging 32-bit process. Instead, if Visual Studio connects to the primary port (see /port),
                it will automatically switch to the 32-bit port when needed.

                prevent users from accidentally connecting to a different user's remote debugger.

            <td class='TableCell'>
                By default, the remote debugger negotiates the strongest Windows authentication
                provider that can be used between the Visual Studio computer and the remote debugger's
                computer. Today, this will generally be Kerberos authentication if both computers
                are on the same domain. This is done to provide the best possible security.
                <br />
                The '/ntlm' option instructions the remote debugger to instead use NTLM authentication
                provider. This option is generally not recommended. However, it can be very useful
                in situations where Kerberos is failing to authenticate.

                Instructs the remote debugger to listen on the network using the specified hostname
                value, or IP address value. On a computer with multiple network cards, or with multiple
                assigned DNS host names, this option can be used to restrict which of these will
                allow remote debugging. For example, a server may have an internet facing address,
                and an internal address. By using '/hostname private_ip_address', remote debugging
                will not be available through the internet facing address.

            <td class='TableCell'>
                The remote debugger tries to load the 2.0 Common Language Runtime (CLR). This option
                suppresses the warning that appears if the installed CLR is incompatible. This option
                is useful if you don't want to debug managed code.

                care. The '/nosecuritywarn' disables these warnings. This option should only be

                in the path where the PDB was originally built and also next to where the dll/exe is 
                currently located. This option may have a performance impact on remote debugging since now

    <p>
        There are several different ways to setup remote debugging.</p>
    <h3>
        Running the remote debugger off a file share</h3>
    <p>
        For many scenarios, the easiest way to setup remote debugging is to run the remote
        debugger (msvsmon.exe) from a file share. Visual Studio installs msvsmon.exe into
        these directories:</p>
    <pre>
 Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 17.0\Common7\IDE\Remote Debugger\x86
 Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 17.0\Common7\IDE\Remote Debugger\x64
 Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 17.0\Common7\IDE\Remote Debugger\arm
    </pre>
    <p>
        By sharing out the 'Remote Debugger' directory on the Visual Studio computer, you
        can run msvsmon.exe on the remote computer.</p>
    <p>
        Features that will not work if msvsmon.exe is run from a share:</p>
    <ul role='directory' aria-label='Features that will not work if msvsmon.exe is run from a share'>
        <li>Launching Windows Store apps. However, it is still possible to manually attach.</li>
        <li>JavaScript debugging</li>
        <li>Stepping into a web service. However, it is still possible to manually attach.</li>
        <li>Automatically launching an ASP.NET site under the debugger. Manually attaching is
            still possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Running remote debugger setup on the remote computer</h3>
    <p>The remote debugger is included in the 'Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2022' 
        installer. The latest version can be downloaded from the Microsoft download center by visiting 
        <a href="http://microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a>, and searching for the product.</p>
    <h1 role="header" id="RemoteDebuggingSecurityHelpLabel">
        <a id="RemoteDebuggingSecurityHelp">Security</a></h1>
    <p>
        The remote debugger supports two authentication modes:</p>
    <ol role='directory' aria-labelledby='RemoteDebuggingSecurityHelpLabel'>
        <li>Windows Authentication mode (used by default)</li>
        <li>No Authentication mode</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Windows Authentication mode</h3>
    <p>
        Windows Authentication mode uses Windows's built-in security to provide a high level
        of security. Kerberos and/or NTLM authenticate and encrypt all requests. The remote
        debugger will, by default, only accept connections from the user who launched the
        remote debugger and members of the Administrators group. Additional users must be
        explicitly granted permissions using Tools->Permissions from within the remote debugger's
        UI, or from the command line using the /allow option.
    </p>
    <h3>
        No Authentication mode</h3>
    <p>
        No Authentication mode has no security. Visual Studio sends the current username
        to the remote debugger, but this information is not verified. No Authentication
        mode should never be used on a network that may have hostile traffic. When using
        no authentication mode, it is recommended to use firewall settings to restrict which
        computers are able to connect to the remote debugger. Even with strong firewall
        settings, no authentication mode offers significantly weaker protection than Windows
        Authentication mode. So it is recommended to use Windows Authentication mode whenever
        possible.</p>

                In No Authentication mode, Visual Studio sends the current user's username to the

                prevent users from accidentally connecting to a different user's remote debugger.
                This option disables the safety check so that any user can connect.

    <h3>
        Permissions dialog</h3>
    <p>
        In Windows Authentication mode, this dialog can be used to specify which users can
        connect and debug through the remote debugger. Only fully trusted users should be
        allowed to debug. If a malicious user was given permission to connect, they would
        be able to take over the user account of the user running the remote debugger.</p>
    <h1 role="header">
        <a id="RemoteDebuggingFirewallConfiguration">Firewall Configuration</a></h1>
    <p>
        To allow remote debugging, any firewalls between the Visual Studio computer and
        the remote debugger must be configured so that the remote debugger (msvsmon.exe)
        will be able to receive data sent from Visual Studio. The remote debugger is able
        to automatically configure the Windows Firewall.</p>
    <p>
        When using a firewall other than the Windows Firewall such as third party software
        firewall or a hardware firewall, the firewall must be manually configured
        to allow remote debugging. To do so, allow traffic on TCP/IP ports that msvsmon.exe
        is listening on. By default, these are port 4026 and 4025,
        where 4026 is used on all operating systems, and 4025
        is used only on Windows x64 to allow debugging x86 processes.</p>

    <p>
        By default, the Remote Debugger Configuration dialog configures the Windows Firewall
        rule to apply to all network profiles (Domain, Private and Informal/Public). The
        Informal/Public configuration enables the scenario when the Visual Studio computer
        is directly connected to a target device via an Ethernet cable. The Visual Studio
        remote debugger uses authentication and encryption to maintain security in this
        scenario.</p>
    
    <p>
        You can disable one or more network profiles by clearing the appropriate checkboxes
        (Domain/Private/Informal). However, if all currently active profiles are unchecked,
        the configuration dialog disables the 'Configure remote debugging' button. For example,
        if your computer is connected to a single network, and this network is an Informal
        network, then unchecking the Informal checkbox will disable the Configure button.</p>

    <h1 role="header">
        <a id="RemoteDebuggingWWS">Windows Web Services</a></h1>
    <p>
        Remote debugging is implemented using the Windows Web Services API. The Windows
        Web Services API is a building block that applications, such as the remote debugger,
        can use to communicate over the network. This API is already included in Windows
        7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later operating systems. For Windows Server 2008 
        (pre-R2), the Visual Studio Remote Tools setup will automatically install the API.</p>
    <h1 role="header">
        <a id="RemoteDebuggingMultiInstance">Running multiple instances of the remote debugger</a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Multiple instances of the remote debugger may be run on the same computer. This
        is required if there is a single server shared by multiple users, and
        each user wants to run their own instance of the remote debugger to debug their
        own processes.</p>
    <p>
        Each instance of the remote debugger must run on its own TCP/IP port number. The
        remote debugger can be configured to listen at a specific port number from Tools->Options
        in the remote debugger, or from the command line using /port:&lt;value&gt;.</p>
    <p>
        To connect to a specific instance of the remote debugger, include the port number
        along with the computer name in the 'remote machine'/'qualifier' setting (ex: MyServer:1234
        to connect to port 1234 on MyServer).</p>
    <h1 role="header">
        <a id="RemoteDebuggingServiceHelp">Running the remote debugger as a service</a></h1>
    <p>
        You can run the remote debugger as either a Windows service or a Windows application.
        Running the remote debugger as a service allows you to easily debug server applications
        such as ASP.NET without logging onto the remote computer.</p>
    <p>
        Running the remote debugger as a service causes it to always run and listen on the
        network. It is not recommended to run the remote debugger as a service for debugging
        client applications.</p>
    <p>
        With the Visual Studio 2022 Remote Debug Configuration wizard, you can control the
        username and password that the remote debugger service runs under. When the remote
        debugger is running as a service, the following requirements must be met to debug
        remotely:</p>
    <ol role='directory' aria-label='Debugger Requirements when running as a service'>
        <li>The user must be a member of the Administrators group to allow debugging of any
            process. </li>
        <li>The user must be granted the 'Log on as a service' privilege. This can be done with
            the 'Local Security Policy' administrative tool. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The default user for the remote debugger service is 'LocalSystem.'</p>
    <p>
        The name of the service is 'Visual Studio 2022 Remote Debugger'. It is recommended
        that you only control the service through the Visual Studio 2022 Remote Debugger
        Configuration wizard. If necessary, it can be controlled through the computer management
        administration tool, or on the command line -- 'net stop msvsmon170' or 'net start
        msvsmon170'.</p>
